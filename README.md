# TSP_SimulatedAnnealing

In this homework, you have to apply simulated annealing algorithm on TSP problem. This
homework, like the first homework, is an open homework, which means you must go through
different experiments and make your code better, but you have to meet the minimum requirements
(At least do a complete test with 100 cities and report). These are the parameters of your program.

1. Number of cities:
Try to increase number of cities, as much as you can till it takes more than some minutes
to give you the answer.

2. Other parameters can be starting temperature, final temperature, temperature decrement
and iterations at each temperature.

3. Follow the uploaded paper for solving TSP using simulated annealing.

You can choose any programming language that you like. Python seems to be better choice. Your
code should have a plotting part and as the program runs, it should show the best result after certain
number of generations.
Write a report, discuss your experience based on parameters, and show several results of different
runs of your code.
